# OneTimePads
CS344 Assignment

Five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. These programs will combine the multi-processing code you have been learning with socket-based inter-process communication. Your programs will also be accessible from the command line using standard Unix features like input/output redirection, and job control. Finally, you will write a short compilation script.

Uses the API for network IPC (socket, connect, bind, listen, & accept to establish connections; send, recv to send and receive sequences of bytes) for the purposes of encryption and decryption by the appropriate servers.
